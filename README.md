# coffeesales

The point of this project was to visaluze sales trends from a coffee company. In this project, I learned about pivot tables, data visualization, data cleaning, and many more valuable data analytics skills! In particular, XLOOKUP functions and Pivot tables really made this project shine. Thank you for viewing!

Sales Data was visualized with data slicers and timelines for greater analysis potential.
